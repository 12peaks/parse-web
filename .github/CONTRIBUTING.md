# Contributing to Parse

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing!

Before submitting a new issue or PR, check if it already exists in [issues](https://github.com/12-peaks/parse-web/issues) or [PRs](https://github.com/12peaks/parse-web/pulls) so you have an idea of where things stand.

Then, once you're ready to begin work, submit a draft PR with your high-level plan (or the full solution).

I'm not going to assign issues to anyone, submitting a draft PR with your work is the best way to claim an issue.

When multiple PRs are submitted for the same issue, I'll take the one that most succinctly & efficiently solves a given problem and stays within the scope of work.

Priority is also generally given to previous committers as they've proven familiarity with the codebase and product.
