# Code of Conduct

This is a personal project that I'm choosing to open source, as such I will not tolerate any form of harassment or abuse.

Rules are simple:

- Be respectful
- Be kind
- Be patient

There is a zero tolerance policy. If you are found to be in violation of this code of conduct, you will be banned from the project.
